# Bash Scripting Workshop for System Automation

by Samuele Albani

---


 In this workshop, we will explore using the Bash command language to gain enhanced control and automation of your system machines and software. Starting with an introduction to Bash fundamentals, we’ll learn how to navigate and work with our system from the terminal. By the end of the session, we’ll apply these skills by developing scripts to automate a computer for a hypothetical exhibition, including timed control of installations. No prior knowledge is required.

You will need your laptop for the session. Bash scripts run natively on Linux and Mac, so Mac and Linux users will have a command line application already.  While Windows users can use (or will need to install) [Git for Window](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/install.html), or [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) .

It’s also recommended to have [Processing](https://processing.org/download) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed.
